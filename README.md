# deoplete-filesrc
This is a simple source for [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim)
to get completion candidates from a file.

## Usage
It was implemented to help dealing with "tag" source, which is dead slow. A lot
of info from the tags file is not needed for completions, so it makes sense to
strip it out after the tags generation and then use that file instead of ctags
subsequently.

Suppose you already have `tags` file generated by ctags. Then you generate
completions from it as follows:

`tail -n +7 tags | awk '{ if (length($1) > 3) print $1 }' | grep -v "::" | sort | uniq >completions`
- `tail -n +7 tags` - remove the ctags header, first 6 lines in the tags file
- `awk '{ if (length($1) > 3) print $1 }'` - print only the tags longer than 3 symbols
- `grep -v "::"` - remove complex C++ names. Every component of such names is already present in the tags independently
- `sort | uniq >completions` - you should know this stuff

The newly generated file will contain only the words needed for completions.

## Configuration
Install the plugin and set the following var to point to the file you want the completions from:

`let g:deoplete#filesrc#path = <path_to_completions_file>`
